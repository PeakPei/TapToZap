# TapToZap
Tap to Zap is a fun iOS game built with SpriteKit in Objective-C. The idea of the game is to destroy bouncing balls on the screen that keep getting smaller the further you play. 

# Integrations

The game uses interstitial ads from [Chartboost](http://chartboost.com) and an integration to [PlayWin.me](https://playwin.me/) is coming in the next update.
